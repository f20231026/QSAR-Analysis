 # QSAR Analysis of Fluoroquinolone & DHFR-Inhibiting Compounds

This project will examine group of **fluoroquinolone antibiotics**, and a potential group of **DHFR (Dihydrofolate Reductase) inhibitors**, to examine how their **molecular properties affect biological activity**. The study utilizes basic QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship) modeling utilizing descriptors such as **LogP** and **TPSA** - which are considered vitally important aspects of drug discovery.



 Significance of this Project in Drug Discovery & Pharmacy

###  What is DHFR?
**Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR)**, is a critical enzyme in the **folate pathway**, which is necessary for DNA synthesis. Specifically, it is:
- A **target for anticancer, antibacterial, and antimalarial** drugs
- Inhibited by drugs like **methotrexate**, **trimethoprim**, and **pyrimethamine**
- A validated **pharmacological target** for designing drugs, so it is ideally suited for computer-aided drug design.

###  What are fluoroquinolones?
Fluoroquinolones are a major class of **broad-spectrum antibiotics** that:
- Target **DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV**
- Represent a wide variety of drugs that are widely used clinically (e.g., ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and moxifloxacin)
- Can be used as a model class for SAR (Structure-Activity Relationship) analysis, coupled to well-defined changes to scaffolds



##  The Importance of QSAR & Descriptors, Like LogP/TPSA

QSAR analysis in Pharmacy and Medicinal Chemistry can be useful to:
- **Predict activity of new analogs**
- Understand the effect of **lipophilicity (LogP)** and **polarity (TPSA)** on:
  - **Bioavailability**
  - **Membrane permeability**
  - **Binding to targets**
- **Improve lead optimization** by performing QSAR analysis that does require costly and time-consuming wet-lab assays

### In this study , **TPSA** showed a stronger correlation (R² = 0.54) with biological activity compared to LogP (R² = 0.45), indicating **polar interactions** may play a more critical role in target binding for this series.
